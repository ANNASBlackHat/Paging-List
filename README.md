# Paging-List
load data into recyclerview by paging: using paging library from jetpack


There are several example on this repository:
### [No Network](https://github.com/ANNASBlackHat/Paging-List/tree/no-network)
This is basic example, just using paging library to load dummy data (created by loop)


### [Network](https://github.com/ANNASBlackHat/Paging-List/tree/network)
Using retrofit to load data from server (public API)


### [Network Generic](https://github.com/ANNASBlackHat/Paging-List/tree/network-generic)
Because of creating paging need bunch of file, that's mean if we have many page need to load by paging, we have to create those files.
So I try to make paging function can be used in any view model which needed
